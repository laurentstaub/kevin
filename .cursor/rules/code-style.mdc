# Code Style Guide

## Formatting Standards
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use spaces around operators and after commas
- No trailing whitespace
- Files must end with a newline

## Naming Conventions
- Variables/Functions: camelCase (`myVariable`, `calculateTotal`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_USERS`, `API_KEY`)
- Classes: PascalCase (`UserAccount`, `TransactionProcessor`)
- Boolean variables: prefix with `is`, `has`, `can` (`isActive`, `hasPermission`)

## Variable Declaration
- Use `const` by default
- Use `let` only when reassignment is necessary
- Avoid `var`
- One variable declaration per line
- Declare variables at the top of their scope

## Code Organization
- Group related code together
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Import/export only what's needed
- Separate concerns appropriately
- css rules not included in html or pug, put is in css file
- no js scripts inline, put it in own js file

## Comments
- Use JSDoc style for function documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Code should be self-documenting when possible
