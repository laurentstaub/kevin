# Testing Standards

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before or alongside code
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Test both expected and edge cases
- Keep tests independent of each other

## Test Structure
```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should describe expected behavior', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });
});
```

## Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test error conditions
- Test boundary cases
- Include integration tests where appropriate

## Testing Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names
- One assertion per test when possible
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep test code as simple as possible
- Use appropriate test doubles (stubs, mocks, spies)

## Development Testing
- Use console.log for quick validation
- Test in small increments
- Verify edge cases manually
- Document test cases and expected results
